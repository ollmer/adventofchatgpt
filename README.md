# Advent of ChatGPT
Solutions for Advent of Code 2022 made by OpenAI ChatGPT and a mere mortal


Each task folder contains assignment text, input file and two solutions for the task, by me and by ChatGPT.
Prompts for ChatGPT was made by prepending content of prompt_prefix.txt to the assignment text and then given to a model at https://chat.openai.com
Some task was solved from the first try, some required a conversation with the model of about 10-15 steps to rewrite a code. But all the solutions in chatgpt.py files are completely generated my the model itself and was not directly modified by human.
